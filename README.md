# Littel Framework

The Littel framework is a CSS and component library that's no-code friendly.

Automatically responsive and highly themeable, the littel framework bundles small atomic styles, with larger components to give you a the most important pieces to build an website or web app from the nuts and bolts up. A small collection of customizable components are also included to speed up development.

Littel is configurable using CSS variables. Almost any value that drives a design decision is changeable without a build process. For example:

```
:root {
    --f-0-min: 1.25; // 20px
    --f-0-max: 2;    // 32px
}
```

Adding the preceding code will change the minimum size of the main font to 20px, and the maximum size to 32px. Any values that depend on the font size will also scale accordingly.
